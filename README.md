```bash
# Just convert to Markdown files
willow-camp ghost-import --ghost-export path/to/ghost-export.json --output-dir path/to/output

# Convert and upload in one step
willow-camp ghost-import -g path/to/ghost-export.json --output-dir path/to/output
```

### Sync a local directory with remote posts

This command will compare the Markdown files in the specified directory with the posts on your Willow Camp site.
- New local files will be uploaded as new posts.
- Local files that are newer than their remote counterparts will update the remote post.
- Remote posts not found locally will be downloaded to the directory.
- Use `--dry-run` to see what changes would be made without actually performing them.

```bash
willow-camp sync -d path/to/markdown/files
```

## Environment Variables

You can set default API URL and token using environment variables:

```bash
export WILLOW_API_URL="https://yourblog.example.com"
export WILLOW_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

If these environment variables are set, you don't need to provide the `-u` and `-t` options.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
